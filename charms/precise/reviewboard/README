Overview
--------

Charm provides Review board - a great webapp for reviewing a source code. 


Usage
-----

To deploy reviewboard:

    juju deploy reviewboard

You should expose this service to be able access it:

    juju expose reviewboard

Now you can accesss the reviewboard but it will use sqlite3 as db and file for caching. For more recommended setting you should deploy and connect another charms:

    juju deploy mysql
    juju expose mysql

    juju deploy memcached
    juju expose memcached

As a last step build relationships with these new services:

    juju add-relation reviewboard mysql
    juju add-relation reviewboard memcached

Use standard http port (80) to access the reviewboard. In config you can change the admin username and password.

Configuration
-------------

Right now this charm runs reviewboard on apache server with wsgi python loader. I hope another options (lighttp for example) will be added soon.
